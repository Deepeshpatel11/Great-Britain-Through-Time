                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>Henry VIII was born on June 28, 1491, at Greenwich Palace, the second son of Henry VII and Elizabeth
                    of York. As a young prince, Henry was well-educated and exhibited a keen interest in theology,
                    music, and sports. Following the death of his elder brother, Arthur, in 1502, Henry became the heir
                    apparent to the English throne.</p>

                <h2>Rise to Power</h2>
                <p>Henry ascended the throne in 1509 at the age of 17. His early reign was marked by his marriage to
                    Catherine of Aragon and his alliance with Spain against France. Henry's desire for a male heir led
                    to his pivotal role in the English Reformation. Unable to secure a papal annulment of his marriage,
                    Henry broke from the Roman Catholic Church and established the Church of England in 1534.</p>

                <h2>Key Milestones</h2>
                <p>Henry VIII's reign saw significant religious and political changes, including the dissolution of
                    monasteries and the centralization of royal authority. His six marriages, particularly to Anne
                    Boleyn and Jane Seymour, were driven by his quest for a male heir. Henry's reign also witnessed the
                    establishment of the Royal Navy and the expansion of English influence abroad.</p>

                <h2>Legacy</h2>
                <p>Henry VIII's legacy is complex, marked by both his ruthless pursuit of personal goals and his
                    significant contributions to the English state. His establishment of the Church of England laid the
                    groundwork for religious reform and the development of a distinct English identity. Henry's reign
                    also left a lasting impact on the monarchy, governance, and culture of England.</p>

                <h2>Modern View</h2>
                <p>Modern historians and the public view Henry VIII as a larger-than-life figure whose actions had
                    far-reaching consequences. His break with the Catholic Church and the establishment of the Church of
                    England are seen as crucial turning points in British history. While his personal life and marriages
                    often capture popular imagination, his political and religious reforms remain subjects of
                    significant historical study and debate.</p>
