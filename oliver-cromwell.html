                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>Oliver Cromwell was born on April 25, 1599, in Huntingdon, England. He was the son of Robert Cromwell
                    and Elizabeth Steward. Cromwell's early life was relatively modest, and he attended Huntingdon
                    Grammar School and later Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, but left before earning a degree. His
                    early adulthood was marked by a struggle to support his family and a personal religious
                    transformation that saw him adopt Puritan beliefs.</p>

                <h2>Rise to Power</h2>
                <p>Cromwell entered politics in 1628 as the Member of Parliament for Huntingdon. He became an outspoken
                    critic of King Charles I and his policies, which eventually led to the outbreak of the English Civil
                    War in 1642. Cromwell emerged as a key military leader for the Parliamentarian forces, known as the
                    Roundheads. His New Model Army played a crucial role in defeating the Royalist forces, and he became
                    one of the most influential figures in the Parliamentary cause.</p>

                <h2>Key Milestones</h2>
                <p>Following the execution of King Charles I in 1649, Cromwell led campaigns in Ireland and Scotland to
                    quell resistance and consolidate the Commonwealth. In 1653, he dissolved the Rump Parliament and was
                    appointed Lord Protector, effectively becoming the head of state. His rule saw efforts at
                    constitutional reform and religious tolerance, although his regime was marked by strict Puritanical
                    codes and military rule. Cromwell's tenure was also characterized by economic and military
                    expansion, particularly in the Caribbean.</p>

                <h2>Legacy</h2>
                <p>Oliver Cromwell remains one of the most controversial figures in British history. He is lauded by
                    some as a champion of liberty and democracy who stood against tyranny and promoted religious
                    freedom. Others view him as a dictator who ruled with an iron fist and suppressed dissent. His
                    actions during the Civil War and his role in the execution of the king have left a complex legacy
                    that continues to be debated by historians.</p>

                <h2>Modern View</h2>
                <p>In modern times, Cromwell is often seen as a key figure in the development of British democracy. His
                    challenges to monarchical power and his advocacy for a government based on merit rather than birth
                    were revolutionary for his time. Despite the authoritarian aspects of his rule, Cromwell's impact on
                    the political landscape of Britain is undeniable. His life and legacy continue to be studied and
                    re-evaluated, reflecting the enduring complexities of his contributions to British history.</p>
