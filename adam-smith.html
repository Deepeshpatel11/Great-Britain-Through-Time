                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>Adam Smith was born on June 16, 1723, in Kirkcaldy, Scotland. He was the son of Adam Smith Sr., a
                    lawyer and customs official, and Margaret Douglas. Smith was raised by his mother after his father's
                    death. At the age of 14, he entered the University of Glasgow, where he studied moral philosophy
                    under Francis Hutcheson. Smith continued his education at Balliol College, Oxford, where he
                    developed an interest in classical economics and the philosophical ideas of the Enlightenment.</p>

                <h2>Rise to Fame</h2>
                <p>Smith's rise to fame began with the publication of his seminal work, "An Inquiry into the Nature and
                    Causes of the Wealth of Nations" (commonly known as "The Wealth of Nations") in 1776. This book laid
                    the foundations for modern economics and introduced groundbreaking ideas about free markets,
                    division of labor, and the nature of wealth. "The Wealth of Nations" was well-received and
                    established Smith as a leading figure in economic thought.</p>

                <h2>Key Milestones</h2>
                <p>In "The Wealth of Nations," Smith introduced key concepts that revolutionized economic theory. He
                    argued that individuals pursuing their self-interest inadvertently contribute to the economic
                    well-being of society, a phenomenon he described as the "invisible hand." Smith also explored the
                    benefits of the division of labor, which increases productivity and efficiency. Additionally, he
                    advocated for free markets and limited government intervention in the economy, laying the groundwork
                    for classical liberalism.</p>

                <h2>Legacy</h2>
                <p>Adam Smith is often referred to as the father of modern economics. His ideas on free markets,
                    competition, and the division of labor have had a profound and lasting impact on economic theory and
                    policy. "The Wealth of Nations" remains a foundational text in economics, and Smith's influence
                    extends to various fields, including political science, philosophy, and public policy. His work
                    continues to be studied and revered for its insights into the functioning of economies.</p>

                <h2>Modern View</h2>
                <p>Today, Adam Smith's ideas continue to shape economic policies and theories. Economists and
                    policymakers draw on his principles to understand and address contemporary economic issues. Smith's
                    emphasis on the benefits of free markets and limited government intervention remains relevant in
                    discussions about globalization, trade, and economic regulation. Modern interpretations of his work
                    often highlight the ethical and moral dimensions of economic activity, reflecting his broader
                    philosophical interests. Smith's legacy endures as a cornerstone of economic thought, and his
                    contributions continue to influence debates on economic policy and practice.</p>
