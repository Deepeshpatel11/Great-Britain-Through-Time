                <h2>Early Life and Rise to Power</h2>
                <p>William was born in 1028 in Falaise, Normandy, the illegitimate son of Robert I, Duke of Normandy, and Herleva, a tanner's daughter. Despite his illegitimacy, he was recognized as Robert's heir, and after Robert's death in 1035, William became the Duke of Normandy. His early reign was marked by violence and instability as he fought to establish his control over the duchy.</p>

                <h2>The Norman Conquest</h2>
                <p>In 1066, upon the death of Edward the Confessor, William claimed the English throne, asserting that Edward had promised it to him and that Harold Godwinson had sworn to support his claim. William gathered a fleet and invaded England, defeating Harold at the Battle of Hastings on October 14, 1066. This victory established William as King of England, and he was crowned on Christmas Day, 1066.</p>

                <h2>Reign as King</h2>
                <p>William's reign brought significant changes to English society, including the introduction of Norman culture, language, and the feudal system. He commissioned the Domesday Book in 1085, a comprehensive survey of his kingdom's lands and resources, which remains a valuable historical document.</p>

                <h2>Legacy</h2>
                <p>William's impact on English history is profound. He reshaped the English aristocracy, redistributed land to his Norman followers, and built numerous castles to secure his control. His reign laid the foundations for modern British governance and law. William died in 1087 and was buried in Caen, Normandy.</p>
