                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>Margaret Hilda Thatcher was born on October 13, 1925, in Grantham, Lincolnshire, England. She was the
                    daughter of Alfred Roberts, a grocer and local alderman, and Beatrice Ethel Roberts. Thatcher was
                    raised in a politically active household and excelled academically, winning a scholarship to
                    Kesteven and Grantham Girls' School. She later attended Somerville College, Oxford, where she
                    studied chemistry and became president of the Oxford University Conservative Association.</p>

                <h2>Rise to Power</h2>
                <p>Thatcher entered politics in 1959, winning a seat as the Member of Parliament for Finchley. She
                    quickly rose through the ranks of the Conservative Party and was appointed Secretary of State for
                    Education and Science in 1970. In 1975, she became the leader of the Conservative Party, and in
                    1979, she made history by becoming the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Her tenure
                    as Prime Minister lasted until 1990, making her the longest-serving British Prime Minister of the
                    20th century.</p>

                <h2>Key Milestones</h2>
                <p>Thatcher's premiership was marked by significant economic and social reforms, known collectively as
                    Thatcherism. These included reducing the power of trade unions, privatizing state-owned industries,
                    and promoting free-market policies. In 1982, she led the country during the Falklands War,
                    successfully reclaiming the Falkland Islands from Argentine occupation. Thatcher's economic policies
                    aimed to curb inflation and stimulate economic growth, but they also led to increased unemployment
                    and social unrest.</p>

                <h2>Legacy</h2>
                <p>Margaret Thatcher's legacy is highly influential and contentious. She is credited with transforming
                    the British economy and reducing the power of the state in economic affairs. Thatcherism reshaped
                    the political landscape, promoting individualism and free enterprise. Her leadership style,
                    characterized by decisiveness and conviction, earned her the nickname "The Iron Lady." Despite her
                    successes, her policies also faced significant opposition, and her tenure saw deep social divisions.
                </p>

                <h2>Modern View</h2>
                <p>Today, Margaret Thatcher remains a polarizing figure. Admirers praise her for revitalizing the
                    British economy and restoring the country's standing on the global stage. Critics argue that her
                    policies exacerbated social inequalities and weakened public services. Thatcher's impact on British
                    politics is undeniable, and she continues to be a subject of extensive debate and analysis. Her
                    legacy is reflected in the ongoing discussions about the role of government in economic management
                    and social policy.</p>
