                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>Sir Isaac Newton was born on January 4, 1643, in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England. He was born
                    prematurely and was not expected to survive. Newton's father died before he was born, and his mother
                    remarried when he was three years old, leaving him in the care of his grandmother. He attended the
                    King's School in Grantham, where he was introduced to the world of mathematics and science. In 1661,
                    he enrolled at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he immersed himself in the study of mathematics,
                    physics, and astronomy.</p>

                <h2>Rise to Fame</h2>
                <p>Newton's rise to fame began with the publication of his landmark work, "Philosophiæ Naturalis
                    Principia Mathematica" (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), commonly known as the
                    "Principia," in 1687. This work laid the groundwork for classical mechanics and introduced his laws
                    of motion and universal gravitation. The "Principia" is considered one of the most important works
                    in the history of science, and it established Newton as a leading figure in the scientific
                    community.</p>

                <h2>Key Milestones</h2>
                <p>In addition to the "Principia," Newton made significant contributions to optics, developing a theory
                    of color based on the observation that a prism could decompose white light into the colors of the
                    visible spectrum. He also invented the reflecting telescope, which used a curved mirror instead of a
                    lens, improving the quality of astronomical observations. Newton's work in mathematics led to the
                    development of calculus, although his work in this area was independently mirrored by Gottfried
                    Wilhelm Leibniz, leading to a famous dispute over the discovery.</p>

                <h2>Legacy</h2>
                <p>Sir Isaac Newton's legacy is vast and enduring. He is regarded as one of the greatest scientists of
                    all time, having laid the foundations for classical mechanics and greatly influencing the fields of
                    mathematics, physics, and astronomy. His laws of motion and universal gravitation became the
                    cornerstone of physics for more than two centuries, until the advent of Albert Einstein's theory of
                    relativity. Newton's work continues to be a fundamental part of scientific education and research.
                </p>

                <h2>Modern View</h2>
                <p>Today, Sir Isaac Newton is celebrated as a pivotal figure in the history of science. His
                    contributions to various scientific fields have left an indelible mark on our understanding of the
                    natural world. Modern scientists and historians view Newton as a brilliant thinker whose work
                    transcended the limitations of his time. His ability to synthesize observation, experimentation, and
                    mathematical rigor remains a model for scientific inquiry. Newton's legacy is honored in numerous
                    ways, including the naming of units of force (newtons) and the continued study of his groundbreaking
                    theories.</p>
