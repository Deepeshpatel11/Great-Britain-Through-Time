                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>William was born in 1028 in Falaise, Normandy, the illegitimate son of Robert I, Duke of Normandy,
                    and Herleva, a tanner's daughter. Despite his illegitimacy, he was recognized as Robert's heir, and
                    after Robert's death in 1035, William became the Duke of Normandy. His early reign was marked by
                    violence and instability as he fought to establish his control over the duchy.</p>

                <h2>Rise to Power</h2>
                <p>In 1066, upon the death of Edward the Confessor, William claimed the English throne, asserting that
                    Edward had promised it to him and that Harold Godwinson had sworn to support his claim. William
                    gathered a fleet and invaded England, defeating Harold at the Battle of Hastings on October 14,
                    1066. This victory established William as King of England, and he was crowned on Christmas Day,
                    1066.</p>

                <h2>Key Milestones</h2>
                <p>William's reign brought significant changes to English society, including the introduction of Norman
                    culture, language, and the feudal system. He commissioned the Domesday Book in 1085, a comprehensive
                    survey of his kingdom's lands and resources, which remains a valuable historical document. William
                    also initiated the construction of numerous castles across England, including the Tower of London,
                    to solidify his control.</p>

                <h2>Legacy</h2>
                <p>William's impact on English history is profound. He reshaped the English aristocracy, redistributed
                    land to his Norman followers, and built numerous castles to secure his control. His reign laid the
                    foundations for modern British governance and law. William died in 1087 and was buried in Caen,
                    Normandy.</p>

                <h2>Modern View</h2>
                <p>Today, William the Conqueror is remembered as a pivotal figure in British history. His successful
                    conquest of England and subsequent reforms significantly shaped the country's development.
                    Historians view his reign as the beginning of a new era in English history, one that transformed the
                    social, political, and cultural landscape of the nation.</p>
