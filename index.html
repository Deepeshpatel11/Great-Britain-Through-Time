                        <small>1028 - 1087</small>
                        <p>Born in 1028 in Normandy, became Duke of Normandy in 1035. In 1066, he claimed the English
                            throne and won the Battle of Hastings, establishing Norman rule in England. His reign
                            brought significant changes in English culture, language, and governance, including the
                            introduction of the feudal system. He commissioned the Domesday Book, a comprehensive survey
                            of his kingdom. William's impact on English history is profound, laying the foundations for
                            modern Britain. He died in 1087 and was buried in Caen, Normandy.</p>

                        <small>1491 - 1547</small>
                        <p>Born in 1491, was the second Tudor king of England. He is best known for his six marriages
                            and his role in the English Reformation, where he broke away from the Roman Catholic Church
                            and established the Church of England. This shift led to significant religious and political
                            changes in England. Henry’s reign saw the dissolution of monasteries and the strengthening
                            of royal authority. His desire for a male heir and subsequent marriages were pivotal in
                            shaping England's religious landscape. Henry died in 1547 and was succeeded by his son,
                            Edward VI.</p>

                        <p>Born in 1533, was the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. She ascended the throne in 1558
                            and reigned for 45 years, marking the Elizabethan Era, a period of English Renaissance and
                            exploration. Under her rule, England defeated the Spanish Armada in 1588, establishing it as
                            a major European power. Elizabeth’s reign saw flourishing arts, with figures like William
                            Shakespeare emerging. She skillfully navigated religious tensions and maintained a
                            Protestant nation. Elizabeth never married, earning the title "The Virgin Queen." She died
                            in 1603, ending the Tudor dynasty.</p>

                        <p>Born in 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon, is widely regarded as one of the greatest playwrights
                            and poets in the English language. He wrote approximately 39 plays, 154 sonnets, and various
                            other poems. His works, including "Hamlet," "Romeo and Juliet," and "Macbeth," explore
                            timeless themes of human nature and have had a profound impact on literature and the arts.
                            Shakespeare’s innovative use of language and dramatic structure set the standard for future
                            playwrights. He died in 1616, but his legacy continues to influence culture and literature

                        <p>Born in 1599, was a key figure in the English Civil War and the subsequent establishment of
                            the Commonwealth of England. As a Puritan leader and military commander, he played a central
                            role in defeating Royalist forces. Following King Charles I's execution, Cromwell became
                            Lord Protector in 1653, ruling England, Scotland, and Ireland with a degree of authority
                            akin to that of a monarch. His tenure saw significant military campaigns and attempts at
                            constitutional reform. Cromwell's influence on English governance endured beyond his death
                            in 1658, despite the eventual restoration of the monarchy.</p>

                        <p>Born in 1643, was an English mathematician, physicist, and astronomer whose work laid the
                            foundations for modern science. He developed the laws of motion and universal gravitation,
                            detailed in his seminal work "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica." Newton also made
                            significant contributions to optics and calculus. His theories revolutionized the
                            understanding of the physical world and influenced subsequent scientific advancements.
                            Newton served as President of the Royal Society and was knighted in 1705. He died in 1727,
                            leaving a lasting legacy as one of history’s most influential scientists.</p>

                        <p>Born in 1723 in Scotland, is known as the father of modern economics. His seminal work, "An
                            Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations" (1776), laid the foundations
                            for classical economics. Smith introduced the concept of the "invisible hand," describing
                            how individual self-interest in a free-market economy can lead to societal benefits. His
                            ideas on the division of labor, productivity, and free markets have profoundly influenced
                            economic policy and theory. Smith also explored moral philosophy in "The Theory of Moral
                            Sentiments." He died in 1790, leaving an enduring legacy in economic thought.</p>

                            1990. Known as the "Iron Lady," she implemented significant economic reforms that reduced

                            economic landscape. Thatcher's policies, known as Thatcherism, promoted free-market
                            principles and reduced government intervention in the economy. Her strong stance during the
                            Falklands War in 1982 and close relationship with US President Ronald Reagan were notable
